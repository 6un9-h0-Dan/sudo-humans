<div class="chunk">
<h2>password has been reset (maybe)</h2>

We're not actually going to tell you if the password was reset or not, since that would allow you to check if a specific email address or username exists in our database, but assuming you typed a valid email or username we have just sent you an email with info on how to reset your password.
