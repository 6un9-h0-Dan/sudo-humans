# In-progress multi-collective features

Define your collectives in settings.js (you need to define all of the fields you see in settings.js.example).

When you create your first user it will be granted all priveleges for all collectives.

Payments for multi-collective are working, just edit your profile and you can edit your membership for each collective.

And it would be really nice to have:

* Automatic emails sent to members when their payments fail. (#64)
* Payment history page for each user that admins can access.
